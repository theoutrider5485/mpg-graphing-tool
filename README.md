# mpg-graphing-tool
Program reads data from Department of Energy, EPA list, displays in graph form.
This program was written in Python 3.8.0, using Visual Studio Code
by me, to fulfill the requirements of CS161 Final Project Assignment

You will need to have Python installed on your computer.
You can find that here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

I used Visual Studio Code, which can be downloaded for free at:
https://code.visualstudio.com/

Matplotlib will need to be installed for this graph to work. 

You can download it using the pip commands:
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib

from matplotlib.org:
If you are on Linux, you might prefer to use your package manager. Matplotlib is packaged for almost every major Linux distribution.

Debian / Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib
Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-matplotlib
Red Hat: sudo yum install python3-matplotlib
Arch: sudo pacman -S python-matplotlib

I hope you enjoy using this. I will likely come back later and add more polish.
